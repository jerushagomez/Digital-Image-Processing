# Skin Cancer Detection using Digital Image Processing 

Digital Image Processing is a set of techniques that is used to deal with images. One can enhance images, focus on a particular feature, classify images and so on. 
In this project, me and Ms. Rashmi S ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashmi-s-91ab41170/)), worked on Skin Cancer Detection. 

## Introduction 
Cancer is a disease in which the cells multiply uncontrollably and eventually spreads from its origin into other parts of the body. While there is no proven cure for cancer, early detection can help increase chances of combatting cancer. Skin cancer is the cancer on the outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis). 

Major Types of Skin Cancer:
- Basal Cell Carcinoma 
- Squamous Cell Carcinoma 
- Melanoma 

Diagnosis of skin cancer includes the following main factors (as part of the ABCD rule):
- Asymmetry 
- Border
- Colour
- Diameter

## Data
- Sourced from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000]
- Contains multi-source dermatoscopic images of pigmented lesions. 
- Pigmented Lesions are used as indicators of Skin Cancer. There are different categories of the same. 

## Problem Statement 
To predict what kind of pigmented lesion is present in an image. This will help understand the kind of skin cancer if it is detected. 

## Methodology in Brief 
- Data loading and pre-processing (missing values, label encoding)
- EDD is performed. 
- Balancing of the data.
- Conversion of the JPG images to RGB pixel data.
- Model is built and fitted. 
- Model is used to predict and the results are cross-verified.
